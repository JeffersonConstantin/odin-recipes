    <h1>Recipes For Fullstack Developers</h1>

    <p>
        Some full stack web developers will proudly orchestrate microservices, tame Kubernetes clusters, and refactor a monolith before lunch—but ask them to cook actual spaghetti and suddenly they’re debugging the “pasta pipeline.” They approach a kitchen like it’s a production outage: aggressively Googling “how to boil water,” optimizing the heat settings for “performance,” and insisting the smoke alarm is just sending “real-time notifications.” If a recipe says “season to taste,” they open 47 tabs, compare Stack Overflow answers, and still deploy a grilled cheese that’s somehow both burnt and undercooked—proof that even in full stack mode, the kitchen is still in beta.

        Here are three recipes for my culinarily handicapped fellow-programmers to dish out (pun intended) on the extremely rare chance that we have some guests coming over and we are in charge of their nourishment! <strong>(God Forbid!!).</strong>
