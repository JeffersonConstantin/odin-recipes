        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    <hr>
        <ul>
        <li>1 box of cake mix (you know, the one that was on sale at the store because it was close to expired)</li>
        <li>1 can of frosting (any flavor; if it’s a little crystallized, that just means it’s extra sweet)</li>
        <li>3 eggs (bonus points if you’ve already cracked one open and didn’t realize it had a crack—texture’s important)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil (or whatever oil you’ve got left in the pantry—peanut oil, avocado oil, or maybe even olive oil if you’re feeling fancy, but that’s just confusing)</li>
        <li>1 cup of random “liquid” (could be water, milk, leftover coffee, or even that juice box from the back of the fridge you found under a pile of takeout menus)</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Instructions:</strong>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> to 350°F (175°C) if you remember. If not, just throw it in there and hope it cooks through. It’ll be fine, probably. </li>
            <li><strong>Mix up the batter:</strong>Open the box of cake mix like you're tearing into a treasure chest. Dump it into a bowl. Add the eggs, oil, and your choice of mystery liquid. Stir it together until it’s kind of smooth but not really. Lumps add “character.” Don’t worry about the consistency—cake is supposed to be fluffy, right?</li>
            <li><strong>Baking pan or… whatever: </strong>Grease a pan (or don’t—honestly, you’re probably not going to remember until it's already baking). Pour the batter in like you’re pretending to be professional, but also not caring if it spills over the sides.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake it:</strong>Pop that batter in the oven and let it bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a fork comes out "mostly clean"—because perfection is overrated, right? (If you’re not sure, just take it out after 30 minutes and assume that’s good enough. No one will notice.)</li>
            <li><strong>Frosting (sort of):</strong> Once the cake has cooled down enough that it doesn’t burn you when you touch it, frost it with that can of frosting. Slather it on like you’re painting a masterpiece—just ignore the uneven layers and that one side where it looks like a frosting explosion. It’s rustic.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional "improvements": </strong>If you have a handful of chocolate chips, sprinkles, or half a banana lying around, toss them on top. It’ll look like you actually thought about this cake for more than 10 seconds. If you’ve got a “party” vibe going on, maybe throw some cereal or crushed-up cookies on there for added texture.</li>
        </ol>

            <strong>Serving Suggestion:</strong> Serve it with a side of “I didn’t have time for a real cake, but here we are” attitude. It pairs well with coffee, regret, or the genuine feeling of accomplishment that comes with using up pantry staples 😆 🍰.
