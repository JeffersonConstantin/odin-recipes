        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    <hr>
        <ul>
        <li>1 box of cake mix (you know, the one that was on sale at the store because it was close to expired)</li>
        <li>1 can of frosting (any flavor; if it’s a little crystallized, that just means it’s extra sweet)</li>
        <li>3 eggs (bonus points if you’ve already cracked one open and didn’t realize it had a crack—texture’s important)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil (or whatever oil you’ve got left in the pantry—peanut oil, avocado oil, or maybe even olive oil if you’re feeling fancy, but that’s just confusing)</li>
        <li>1 cup of random “liquid” (could be water, milk, leftover coffee, or even that juice box from the back of the fridge you found under a pile of takeout menus)</li>
        </ul>
