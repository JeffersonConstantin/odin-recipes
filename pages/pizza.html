        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    <hr>
    <p>    
        <ul>
        <li>1 sad, leftover tortilla or any flat thing that vaguely resembles pizza dough <em>(don’t worry, no one will judge you)</em></li>
        <li>1/4 cup of whatever tomato sauce you have — pizza sauce, ketchup, or that one jar of marinara you keep promising you’ll use <em>(it’s been there since 2019, we get it)</em></li>
        <li>1 handful of shredded cheese <em>(if you’re lucky, it’s mozzarella, but honestly, any cheese will do at this point—cheddar, parmesan, or even American slices that are already way past their prime)</em></li>
        <li>A few slices of questionable lunch meat or hot dog bits <em>(extra points if it’s something you can’t even identify)</em></li>
        <li>Olive oil or whatever is closest to it in your pantry <em>(or just butter, we’re not picky)</em></li>
        <li>A dash of spices <em>(Italian seasoning, chili flakes, or even a mystery packet of seasoning from that pizza place you ordered from last year)</em></li>
        <li><strong><em>The courage to throw it in the oven</em></strong></li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Instructions:</strong>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Preheat the oven:  </strong> (if you can remember to do that ahead of time) to 375°F (190°C). If you don’t feel like waiting, just throw it in there and hope for the best. We’re cooking with passion, not precision.</li>
            <li><strong>Prep your base:</strong> Lay down your sad, leftover tortilla (or pizza crust, or pita bread, or really anything flat). If it's not perfectly round, that's just added <em>character.</em></li> 
            <li><strong>Apply sauce: </strong>Spread whatever’s left in your tomato sauce jar—don’t even measure, just glop it on there. Ketchup? Sure, why not. It’s 3 AM, and this is a “personal pizza.” You do you.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese it up: </strong>Scatter your cheese across the top. Remember, it’s not about the quantity, it’s about how much cheese you can melt to mask all other flavors. The more mystery cheese, the better.</li>
            <li><strong>Add toppings: </strong>Now, throw on those questionable lunch meats, half-eaten olives, or whatever sad vegetables you found lurking in the fridge. Heck, if you’ve got pickles, throw them on there too. It’s your world, I’m just living in it.</li>
            <li><strong>Spice it up: </strong>Sprinkle a bit of Italian seasoning, chili flakes, or whatever random spice packet you can find. This is the part where you pretend like you actually planned this and didn’t just throw everything together in a PANIC.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake: </strong>Pop it in the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted, bubbling, and your kitchen smells like a mix of “please don’t burn” and “I’m already regretting this.”</li>
            <li><strong>Optional finishing touch:</strong> If you have leftover ranch dressing or hot sauce, drizzle it over the top like you’re the star of a food competition. And if it looks like something went wrong, just tell everyone it’s “fusion cuisine.”</li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Serving Suggestion:</strong>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cut into random shapes to avoid disappointment. Pair with a glass of whatever’s left in your fridge—whether it's juice, expired milk, or a questionable soda.

        And there you go, <strong>Desperation Pizza:</strong> the meal that says, “I’ve got 3 minutes and 5 ingredients left, but we’re going to make this work.” 🍕✨
