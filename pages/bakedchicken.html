    <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    <hr>
     <ul>
        <li>4 chicken breasts (or whatever you have left in the fridge, we’re not picky)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil (or any oil that looks like it’s supposed to be used for cooking)</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder (to distract from the fact it’s slightly charred)</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika (because you’re trying to convince yourself you’re fancy)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce (for extra mystery flavor)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste (remember, not too much—there’s always room for more salt after it burns)</li>
        <li>1 lemon (because you might want to squeeze it over the “charred goodness” if you’re feeling gourmet)</li>
        <em>Optional: A splash of wine (for you, not the chicken)</em>
    </ul>

         <strong>Instructions:</strong>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat your oven</strong> to 400°F (or 200°C). Pretend to know what that means in terms of actual cooking time.</li>
            <li> <strong>Prepare the chicken:</strong> If it’s frozen, just toss it in the oven anyway, who’s going to notice? Rub the chicken breasts with olive oil, then sprinkle with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Apply with love, or indifference, depending on your mood.</li>
            <li><strong>Soy sauce drama:</strong> Drizzle the soy sauce over the chicken like you’re starring in a cooking show, making sure to spill half of it on the counter for authenticity.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pop the chicken in the oven for 20-30 minutes (but you know it’s probably going to be closer to 45 minutes because you forgot to set the timer). Watch Netflix or scroll on your phone and don’t check on it.</li>
           <li><strong> Check for doneness:</strong> When the chicken looks like it might have been in a small fire, you’re on the right track. Stick a meat thermometer in there. If it reads 165°F (75°C), you’re golden. If not, just pretend like the “crispy bits” are intentional.</li>
           <li><strong>Serve with pride:</strong> Squeeze lemon on top to cover up any burnt spots (unless you’re a true rebel and want to keep the “extra crispy” look). Throw some microwaveable mashed potatoes on the side, and act like you spent hours on this.</li>
           <em> Optional: If you're feeling adventurous (and desperate for redemption), pair it with a nice glass of wine—because at least something in the meal will be edible.</em>
        </ol>
